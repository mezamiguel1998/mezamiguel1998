        <h3>Introduction</h3>
        <p>My name is Miguel and I wanted to create this website to  make sure that unsolved cases would still have the deserved attention needed to be solved. I have always had a passion for true crime and now I have the opportunity to make something of the topic I enjoyed hearing about. I have always felt it was important to keep ourslves grounded and to underdstand these are real tragic events that happened to poeple and as such treat them with respect.</p>
