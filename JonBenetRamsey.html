        <h1>JonBenet Ramsey Case: Boulder Police Respond to Unearthed DNA Bombshell</h1>

        <p>
      The Boulder Police Department has responded to a report about a potential "game changer" DNA evidence in the JonBenet Ramsey case. JonBenet, a six-year-old beauty queen, was found dead in her family's Boulder, Colorado, home on December 26, 1996. The murder has remained unsolved for more than two decades. A recent news report cited a source claiming that new DNA evidence could help solve the case. However, the Boulder Police Department stated that the report is not accurate and they have not received any new DNA evidence in the Ramsey case. The investigation continues as authorities seek answers and closure to this tragic and perplexing case.
